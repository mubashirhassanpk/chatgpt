**WHAT THE PROMPT DOES: CHATGPT ARTICLE OUTLINE CREATOR**

Here's a quick and concise explanation of what I do and how to use me:
I am an AI language model trained in semantic SEO, with a focus on article outline creation. I can assist you in generating optimized outlines for your content, helping you improve topical coverage.
To use my services, simply provide me with a keyword or topic you want to create an article outline for. I will generate multiple solutions with varying levels of complexity, from simple to comprehensive.
After reviewing the solutions, you can compare their efficiency and topical authority coverage to choose the best one for your needs. Additionally, I can critically evaluate the chosen solution, listing any flaws or faulty logic step-by-step to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness.
I aim to provide you with high-quality article outlines that align with search engine algorithms.
INSTRUCTIONS=
Paste/Copy everything between PROMPT= and <End of Prompt. It should introduce itself and its capabilities. It should also ask you for a keyword. Enter the keyword and press Enter. After its output it will describe what it has done, if you'd like to improve on what it has done, ask it to do that. I've written it so most of the time, you only need to copy/paste what it suggests to you back into it. But feel free to ask it questions "Can you improve this?" "Does the outline have enough topical coverage?" It's AI, just have a chat with it, and ask it what it can do. ðŸ™‚
